## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- ESXi-only (drop vCenter support): Simplifies codebase, matches actual use case
- Remove vCenter-only tools entirely: Cleaner than returning "not supported" errors
- Rename VCENTER_* config keys to ESXI_*: User-facing clarity, no compatibility burden
- Breaking changes acceptable: Greenfield usage, no backwards compat needed
